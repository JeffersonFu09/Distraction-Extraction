# Distraction-Extraction
Project for Starterhack 2020
Distraction Extraction was a web application that allows users to enter in different websites and applications that is on their computer and blacklists them.
If the user is on blacklisted apps or sites, the app will read how long the user is on the site and if the time exceeds 5 minutes, the app will alert the user and tell them
to stop being distracted and to get back on track.

How it was built:
- Distraction Extraction's front end user interface was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- The site was hosted locally using NodeJS.
- Distraction Extraction used the software company Rescue Time's API to track user activity.
